## Learn anything and become anyone.

A free, open source platform, to which you may contribute anytime, mainly about a recursive tree-view graph visualization of relevant topics and their subtopics, enabling you to learn about anything and with todo lists become anyone.

This is the official development repository of *beacon*.

For adding new content instead, please have a look [here](https://github.com/kjellherzke/beacon-content), as we are looking actively for contributors in terms of community content.

That's it, for now.
